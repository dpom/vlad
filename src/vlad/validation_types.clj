  "The core of vlad is the `Validation` protocol. It simply requires that your
  validation type knows how to run against some data. Implementations of
  `validate` should return a sequence of errors. An error may be anything but
  is generally of the form `{:type ::something :some-extra-data 123}`."

  other validations. It is used as the identity value for reducers/monoid
  functions (Don't panic. You don't need to know what that means to use vlad)."

;; Two validations can be composed in a `Join`. When `validate` is called their
;; error messages will be combined into one sequence You can nest joined
;; validations and they will be recursively traversed.

;; `Chain` can also be using for composing validations. However it will fail
;; fast, only returning the first validation if it fails. If the first
;; validation failed with multiple errors (ie: you're chaining a `Join`) then
;; all of those errors will still be returned

;; Predicates are simple functions that take some data and return a boolean
;; value. They're ideal for use as validators and so `Predicate` exists to make
;; wrapping them up easy. All that's needed to turn a predicate into a
;; validator is a selector (for drilling down into data) and an error message.
